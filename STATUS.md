# OpenPlan3D status

Last verified: **September 13, 2026, 12:50 EDT**.

## Work paused by user

Implementation and validation are paused at the user's request until access to
the Asta 6 model is restored. The overall `NEXT.md` goal remains active and is
not marked complete. No build, test, browser, or native QA job is running.

## Goal and overall state

**Active goal: keep working on all outstanding issues in `NEXT.md`.**

The goal is not complete. Recent fixes are committed and pushed, but broader fidelity work,
physical-device testing, and release/cloud gates remain open.

Web PR #95 has merged into `main` as `4bdc00d`; its development branch was
removed from the remote and local checkout.

This is the concise, maintained status page. Update it as implementation,
validation, blockers, or priorities change during the goal. Keep the full scope
in [NEXT.md](NEXT.md); do not treat a focused test pass as completion of the goal.

## Repository checkpoints

These are implementation checkpoints; later documentation commits may follow.
Remote state was checked when preparing this report.

| Repository | Branch | Latest implementation checkpoint | Delivery |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Web app: `openPlan3D` | `main` | `4bdc00d` — merged PR #95, including interior area comparison | Committed, pushed and merged; [PR #95](https://github.com/laanlabs/openPlan3D/pull/95) is merged |
| Native app: `openplan3d-ios` | `codex/local-floorplan-render` | `bdaad71` — area convention baseline | Committed and pushed |
| Website: `openplan3d-www` | `main` | `4802b01` — WebP image delivery and CDN caching | Committed and pushed; local checkout matches remote `main` |

All three working trees are clean and match their remotes at this pause. The web
development branch was removed after merge. Native app work remains on its own
development branch. Pushing the
website changes does not, by itself, verify a production deployment.

## Work completed with scoped verification

- **Website:** stronger links to the [OpenPlan3D App Store listing](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/openplan3d/id6759076170).
- **Furniture reflection:** actual local-axis mirroring, unchanged rotation,
  duplication, native glyph/SceneKit rendering, SVG export, neutral-export face
  winding, RoomPlan orientation, and web/native package handling. An actual native
  UI → web service → native UI round-trip retained reflection.
- **Imported-package reflection:** fixed the native merger that discarded new
  mirror edits on re-export. Native/web package import, save, and export regression
  passed, including true/false/removal and preservation of unrelated data.
- **Local custom-model import:** bounded GLB validation/import, retained original
  bytes, placement and storage handling, resource cleanup, and scoped desktop
  browser checks. Native retention is supported; native GLB rendering is not.
- **Editor and tracing-image work:** native action labels, dismissal fixes,
  floor ownership, rotation and fitting, with scoped native tests/UI checks.
- **Regression infrastructure:** separated Vitest benchmarks from Playwright
  collection. Both CI benchmark profiles subsequently ran and passed all three
  furnished-home cases. Browser CI now uses six shards per engine.
- **Raster export:** rounded PNG/PDF canvas dimensions up within the 4096-pixel
  cap to address Firefox exporting 4095 pixels instead of 4096. The moved-label
  export workflow now passes unchanged in all three browser engines.

## Validation state

| Check | Evidence and limits |
| --- | --- |
| Full native simulator suite | **265 passed, two optional integration skips, zero failures** on `2fc1dd9`, including the height properties UI source. Session `64276` exited 0; XCTest 130.573 seconds. |
| Full native Catalyst suite | **265 passed, two optional integration skips, zero failures** on `8fdd1bf`. Session `25783` exited 0; XCTest 142.046 seconds. |
| Later native package-merger regression | **Passed**, exit 0, 1.086 seconds, on `72906c0`. This is a focused regression, not a newer full native suite. |
| Full web unit suite | **1,142 passed in 119 files** in CI run `34735405519` on the status-bar/height implementation. Type check and production build also passed. The earlier local timeout results are superseded for this source. |
| Raster export unit tests and build | **27 tests passed**; production build passed. |
| Earlier local full browser run | 35 passed, five timeouts, 1,139 unrun. All five timed-out cases later passed unchanged on the current-at-that-time build. Full coverage was not achieved. |
| Earlier CI browser run | All engines exceeded the 12-minute suite limit; Firefox also exposed the raster-width assertion failure. This motivated sharding and the raster fix. |
| Current full browser CI | **All 18 shards passed** in run `34735405519`, including Linux Firefox shard 3: 74 passed in 5.6 minutes. |
| Shard inventory | All **1,179 cases** occur exactly once: 393 per engine, divided into groups of 71/61/74/58/64/65. This verifies collection, not execution. |
| Benchmark CI | Desktop: three passed; phone viewport: three passed. Software-rendered measurements do not qualify physical-phone performance. |

## Native height editing — scoped UI check passed

Native `2fc1dd9` adds decimal height entry in cm/in and an explicit category-height
reset. Catalyst build `64930` passed. Isolated native UI entered 48.5 in and saved
1.2318993347743592 m after Undo → Redo, with width/depth unchanged. Metric entry reopened as 213.7 cm; category reset displayed 90 cm and persisted
0.9 m after rejecting a zero entry, with neighboring furniture unchanged.
Other invalid input forms, intermediate undo value, and iOS/device checks remain
open. Full current simulator run `64276` passed: 265 passed, two optional skips,
zero failures; XCTest 130.573 seconds, exit 0. Log:
`/tmp/native-height-editor-full-simulator.log`. Actual native UI export bytes
also pass all 39 web package tests, retaining both edited heights and all 12
legacy furniture records. A subsequent stable-panel Save check created
`/Users/thelodgem1/Documents/native-ui-height-save-final.zip`; its plan bytes
exactly match the edited-height regression fixture. Selected-destination export
is now verified. Earlier missing-file attempts remain inconclusive.
The full Catalyst suite below predates the properties UI.
Native detail: `openplan3d-ios/docs/native-furniture-height-editor.md`.

## Furniture-height preservation verified in Catalyst handoff

Native `8fdd1bf` adds optional measured height in metres, preserves it through
RoomPlan import, saved plans, duplication, SceneKit preview, RoomPlan export,
and retained-package merging, and rejects invalid heights on decode/package
validation. Legacy plans retain category defaults. Both focused simulator tests
passed (exit 0; 0.022 and 0.057 seconds). Web `79633db` now imports/exports
physical height, preserves Z scale, retains heights omitted by older encoders,
and keeps flat catalog symbols valid. All 92 package/category tests and the web
type check passed. **Actual web service → Catalyst UI → web service package handoff passed**.
Native import/save/preview/export retained 3.125 m height; web return retained
125 cm at Z scale 2.5, reflection, rotation and attachment bytes. All 38 package
tests passed with the actual native export fixture. Both full native suites
passed. Physical-device handoff and richer furniture previews remain open.
See the [handoff record](docs/reviews/2026-09-12-furniture-height-handoff.md).

## Phone status-bar repair verified

The failed Linux Firefox screenshot shows the horizontal scrollbar covering the
status-button text. The workflow passed unchanged in local macOS Firefox, so a
local pass alone did not close the CI defect. Web `5e09840` gives the phone status
bar a 48 px minimum height and centers its controls, leaving room for a classic
scrollbar. Existing pointer/interaction assertions remain; the test also checks
that each button fits its text line and captures phone screenshots. The build
passed. All six local desktop/phone cases passed in 1.8 minutes. Linux Firefox
shard 3 subsequently passed all 74 tests in 5.6 minutes in CI run `34735405519`,
qualifying the repair in the original failing environment.

## Current validation and CI

- **Full native simulator completed:** `64276` completed 267 reported tests:
  265 passed, two optional skips, zero failures. Log: `/tmp/native-height-editor-full-simulator.log`.
- **Full native Catalyst completed:** `25783` exited 0: 265 passed, two optional
  skips, zero failures; XCTest 142.046 seconds. Log: `/tmp/native-height-full-catalyst.log`.
- **Implementation CI completed successfully:** [run 34735405519](https://github.com/laanlabs/openPlan3D/actions/runs/34735405519)
  passed all 1,142 unit tests, type check, build, all 18 browser shards and both
  benchmark profiles. This qualifies the implementation at `3020a65`; later
  changes through `0fcae31` were tests/documentation. Build log: `/tmp/openplan-statusbar-ci-build.log`.
- **Height handoff package generated:** passing fixture run `81629` produced
  `/tmp/web-height-return-package.zip`, with native height 3.125 m and web height
  125 cm at Z scale 2.5. Actual Catalyst import/save/export and web service return
  subsequently passed; regression session `25778` passed all 38 package tests.
- **Native furniture-height regression completed:** session `40396` exited 0;
  both tests passed. Log: `/tmp/native-furniture-height-regression.log`.
- **Raster browser regression completed:** session `26950` exited successfully;
  all three cases passed in 2.2 minutes (Chromium 39.5 s, Firefox 58.2 s, WebKit
  15.8 s). Log: `/tmp/web-raster-rounding-browser.log`.
- **Phone status-bar browser regression completed:** session `85538` exited 0;
  all six desktop/phone cases passed in 1.8 minutes. Log:
  `/tmp/web-mobile-statusbar-browser.log`. Build `35608` passed.
  Focused Firefox phone screenshot run `43494` also passed; the inspected image
  shows the full Grid label. Log: `/tmp/web-mobile-statusbar-visual.log`.
  Linux Firefox CI confirmation passed (74 tests in shard 3). See the
  [before/after record](docs/reviews/2026-09-12-mobile-statusbar.md).
- **Web height production build:** session `74745`, log
  `/tmp/web-package-height-production-build.log`; passed with exit 0.
- **Completed sharded CI:** [run 34734473227](https://github.com/laanlabs/openPlan3D/actions/runs/34734473227)
  passed its build, both benchmarks, and 17 of 18 browser shards. Firefox shard 3
  failed the Portuguese layers test at 390 px: a bottom overlay intercepts clicks
  on the Grid button. That defect was repaired and verified in the later successful run above. Log: `/tmp/openplan-ci-firefox-shard3-failure.log`.


## Next priorities

1. Continue furniture fidelity and height editing usability; complete physical
   iPhone/iPad handoff when a device is available. The Catalyst UI/package
   preservation check is complete, with its actual export retained as a fixture.
2. Continue the nested-room Undo investigation. New state coverage verifies
   grouped drag preview → saved edit → repeated Undo/Redo for saved and detected
   rooms: all 16 history/resolution/nesting tests passed. This excludes stale
   preview metadata for that sequence; browser event/draw ordering remains
   unproven and the original intermittent failure has no established root cause.
3. Continue area alignment: Area Summary now shows a separate interior total
   and explicitly describes the existing centerline breakdown. The new wall-
   footprint calculation matches native's 10.64 m² rectangle baseline; 18
   geometry tests and all three localized browser workflows passed, as did
   production build. Labels, schedules/exports and arbitrary native raster
   agreement remain open. See the [area record](docs/area-convention-baseline.md).
   Broader geometry, usability, performance and release work remains open.

## Remaining goal scope

- Native/web area conventions, room split/merge behavior, geometry agreement,
  curves, slopes, elevations, opening styles, annotations, roofs and stair voids.
- Catalog completeness, provenance, furniture/rendering fidelity, materials,
  framing, and device-based performance/memory/battery targets.
- Full English/Portuguese interface review, physical accessibility, and first-use
  usability sessions.
- Physical iPhone/iPad capture, denied permissions, interruptions, long scans,
  touch interactions, multi-floor/attachment-heavy projects, and file/share handoff.
  No physical device was connected at the last inventory check.
- TestFlight/App Store, distribution, Intel support and licensing/release checks.
- Firebase client migration, storage admission/rules cutover, enforceable quotas,
  billing/budget decisions, and later AI/collaboration work behind those cost gates.

These are open work areas, not a claim that every item is a reproduced defect.
Physical-device and administrative gates need their corresponding external
evidence, but there is still software work available; the overall goal is active.

Local `/tmp` logs are diagnostic artifacts and may not survive machine cleanup;
the committed records and linked CI runs retain the summarized validation scope.
