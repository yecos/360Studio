### 🟡 Medium Priority (Polish & depth)
6. **Drag & drop from catalog** — Currently click-to-place
7. **Photo-realistic catalog thumbnails** — Big visual upgrade
8. **Larger furniture catalog** — ~43 items vs 1000+; add appliances, more variants
9. **Right-click context menu** — Standard UX pattern

- **Door/window system is feature-complete** — 6 door types, 5 window types, 4-direction flip, placement preview, distance dimensions
- **Export is strong export support** — SVG, DXF/DWG without premium, plus PDF, PNG, JSON
- **Material system** — 15 wall colors + 6 wall textures + 14 floor materials, all in 2D and 3D
- **Decor & lighting** — Rugs, plants, curtains, art + 7 lighting fixtures with real 3D light sources
- **Stairs** — Straight stairs with treads/risers in both 2D and 3D
- **Image import** — Trace-over with two-point scale calibration, opacity control, lock/unlock
- **Multi-select** — Marquee drag + shift-click, bulk delete

## BIGGEST REMAINING GAPS

- **No cloud save / multi-project** — Single localStorage project
- **Furniture catalog depth** — ~43 vs 1000+ items
- **No multi-floor 3D stacking** — Can't see full building
- **No outdoor/landscape** — No trees, paths, pools
- **Construction elements** — No columns, arches, roofs, fireplaces
- **3D visual quality** — Procedural textures vs PBR realistic materials
