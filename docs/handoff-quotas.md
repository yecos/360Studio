# Hosted handoff admission and migration

Source paths below refer to the web repository, `laanlabs/openPlan3D`.

The updated iPhone client sends geometry JSON to `POST /api/handoffs` on the
existing web backend. Local editing and Editable Plan JSON export do not use
this service. No database or extra hosted service is introduced.

## Deployment state

This release stages the quota endpoint and updates the companion client.
**The existing public Storage create rule remains deployed for older iPhone
builds. Consequently, the bucket is not yet protected by an aggregate quota.**
The cutover candidate is `ops/storage-quota-cutover.rules`; it is deliberately
not referenced by `firebase.json`. Closing the old path requires confirming that
distributed iPhone clients have migrated. App Store/TestFlight publication is
separate from merging the companion source.

## Endpoint contract

- Request: `Content-Type: application/json`, the complete validated RoomPlan or
  prepared iPhone handoff payload. Actual streamed bytes are limited to 1 MiB;
  a misleading/missing Content-Length cannot bypass the check. Body reading
  times out after ten seconds. Compressed request bodies are rejected.
- Success: HTTP 201 with `{ "code": "ABCDEFGH", "reuseUntil": "...ISO timestamp..." }`.
  The client builds its link to `/editor?import=CODE`. The randomly generated code
  uses the existing eight-character alphabet, and object creation is conditional
  on the object not already existing.
- `reuseUntil` limits client caching to 24 hours; it is **not a guaranteed deletion
  or read-access deadline**. The prefix lifecycle makes captures eligible for
  deletion after one day, and deletion is asynchronous.
- Failure: JSON `{ "error": "..." }`. HTTP 413 is too large; 415 is an unsupported
  media type; 422 is malformed geometry; 429 is an admission limit; 503 is
  unavailable/busy. Limited/busy responses include `Retry-After` when applicable.
  Responses and new capture objects use `Cache-Control: no-store` (objects also
  specify `private`). Clients offer file export instead of retrying automatically.

## Enforced limits on this endpoint

| Limit | Initial value |
| --- | --- |
| One capture | 1 MiB |
| Upload reservations per UTC day | 100 |
| Reserved capture bytes per UTC day | 25 MiB |
| Upload reservations per UTC minute | 10 |

The constants live in `src/lib/server/handoffQuota.ts`. They are conservative
initial capacity limits, not a dollar budget. Changing them requires a reviewed
deployment. An additional process-local guard admits at most 30 requests per
minute into parsing/storage work; it is not the authoritative global quota.

A zero-byte object, `_system/handoff-admission-v1`, stores the current day/minute
and counters in metadata. The existing runtime identity accesses it through IAM;
Firebase rules deny public access to this path. A reservation uses **both generation
and metageneration** preconditions. Conflicting instances retry at most five times;
metadata/auth/network failures fail closed. A failed or uncertain capture write
keeps its reservation, so retries cannot reclaim capacity already consumed.
Code collisions retry at most three times and never overwrite an existing capture.

Metadata-only updates advance metageneration without creating a new data
generation. Each normal accepted upload adds one quota read and one metadata write
to the capture write; conflicts can add bounded retries. These operations and
App Hosting requests still have costs. This does not cap download traffic or
total Firebase spending. See [GCS preconditions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/request-preconditions)
and [object metadata](https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/metadata).

The iPhone app hashes canonical JSON and reuses successful links until one minute
before their reuse deadline. Concurrent identical sends share one request. A
bounded local cache persists only hashes, codes and expiry, never capture contents.
Changed geometry/import settings and expired entries trigger a new explicit upload.

## Configuration and cutover

Self-hosted deployments default to sharing disabled. Enable only with
`HANDOFF_UPLOADS_ENABLED=true` and `HANDOFF_BUCKET` set to the intended bucket.
Set adapter-node's `BODY_SIZE_LIMIT=2M` so its default 512 KiB limit does not
reject valid 1 MiB captures before the endpoint can enforce its own limit.
The runtime needs Application Default Credentials with object get/create/update
access for `inbox/` and the ledger. App Hosting already supplies its service
identity; do not add service-account key files to the repository or browser.
The OpenPlan3D backend's existing identity already has these permissions; this
release does not expand IAM access. Browser CI explicitly disables cloud sharing.
The token requests `devstorage.full_control`: the Storage JSON API's
`objects.patch` method requires that scope even for custom metadata updates;
`devstorage.read_write` allows inserts but fails subsequent quota updates.
See the method scopes in the [official API definition](https://storage.googleapis.com/$discovery/rest?version=v1).

After the new client is distributed and the compatibility decision is confirmed:

1. Verify a synthetic updated-client share and web import against production.
2. Replace `storage.rules` with the reviewed cutover candidate, commit it, and
   deploy only Storage rules for project `openplan3d`. Keeping the root rules in
   sync prevents a later routine deployment from reopening public writes.
3. Verify direct anonymous creates and public ledger access are denied; verify
   quota-approved writes, existing-code reads, and local file export still work.
4. Keep the one-day `inbox/` lifecycle. Do not apply that lifecycle to the ledger.
   Recheck retained live/soft-deleted bytes and the agreed operating budget.

Older apps' direct uploads will fail after cutover. Reopening that rule restores
compatibility but also restores the quota bypass. Avoid describing the staged
release as full enforcement while this path remains open.
