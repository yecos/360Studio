# Catalog localization browser qualification — stopped on caption regression

Runtime source: `87d3c8658ea7ce877354a3353d6c5503091fe428`. The working tree was
clean at the initial launch. Inventory: 1,107 cases in 139 files, across Chromium, Firefox
and WebKit. Production code has not changed during this qualification.

The initial full run exited with one failure and 1,106 unrun cases. Its first
Chromium case found the page still displaying the translated 3D loading message
at the 10-second canvas-readiness deadline. The captured trace showed no
application error. The test now allows up to 60 seconds for this lazy-load
boundary, inside its existing 180-second overall deadline. No assertions were
removed. The restarted full run passed that case (1.3 minutes), including
placement and exact Undo/Redo export comparisons. That run then finished with
six passes and one failure: the AI-panel case also reached its 10-second canvas
deadline while the page still displayed the 3D loading message. Its readiness
wait is now 60 seconds inside a 180-second overall allowance; its assertions and
network-request guard remain intact. Six distinct completed case identities were
matched against the original inventory and excluded from a 1,101-case continuation.
Playwright's own list command confirms that continuation count.

The 1,101-case continuation passed the AI-panel case, then exhausted the direct
AI-provider test's 60-second overall deadline while starting its no-image
recovery step. The successful render, request checks and byte-exact download
assertions had completed. This multi-stage workflow now has a 180-second
slow-test allowance; success, failure, cancellation, reload and network guards
remain intact. The two completed runs contain seven distinct passes. Their
union was checked against the original inventory; Playwright confirms 1,100
remaining cases for the next continuation.

The 1,100-case continuation ended after 41 passes and one timeout (1,058 unrun).
The background-image workflow exhausted its 60-second overall deadline during
final calibration, after its earlier cancellation, invalid-input, image-byte,
property-edit, removal and Undo checks. It now has a 180-second slow-test
allowance, retaining all assertions. The log also reports an error outside a
test without a separate diagnostic; this is not treated as passing evidence.
The union of completed stages contains 48 distinct inventory cases. Playwright
confirms the next continuation contains 1,059 cases. Production is unchanged.

The 1,059-case continuation passed the complete background workflow in 1.8
minutes, then the camera case timed out at its 10-second first-preview GPU poll.
The trace shows the preview controls visible and a GPU evaluation started with
no returned result before that deadline; it does not prove a rendering defect.
The first-frame poll and initial canvas readiness now allow 60 seconds within a
180-second workflow. Capture dimensions and renderer cleanup assertions remain.
There are 49 distinct retained passes; Playwright confirms 1,058 remaining cases.

The next continuation passed camera capture/cleanup (2.1 minutes) and both
canvas-hint cases. The canvas-idle workflow then exceeded its 10-second 3D
readiness assertion near the end, with the snapshot showing “Loading 3D viewer…”.
That boundary now allows 60 seconds within a 180-second total workflow; idle,
pixel-change, saved-state and teardown checks remain intact. There are 52
retained distinct passes and 1,055 remaining cases, confirmed by Playwright.

The 1,055-case continuation passed 30 cases, including the full canvas-idle
workflow (2.6 minutes). The crossing-room case then timed out clicking an
onboarding tip after checking visibility. Its final snapshot contains no tip;
OnboardingTooltip.svelte automatically dismisses tips after eight seconds. The
test now waits for the transient tip to become hidden instead of racing its
removal. Its three scene exports and all slab geometry assertions remain;
the full workflow has a 180-second allowance. The inventory union now contains
82 distinct passes; Playwright confirms 1,025 remaining cases.

The next continuation passed seven cases, including crossing-room slab exports
and all curved-opening placement cases, then the curved-opening mesh export
hit the same auto-dismiss tip race. All eight remaining identical optional
hint-click patterns now wait for hidden state, bounded at 15 seconds. The
curved-opening export workflow also has a 180-second allowance; geometry,
framing, idle and walkthrough assertions are unchanged. The inventory union
contains 89 distinct passes and 1,018 remaining cases.

The 1,018-case continuation passed 13 cases, including both curved-opening
mesh variants and curved rooms. The asset-cache workflow then exhausted its
60-second total deadline during offline 3D reload, after cold-load asset limits,
cache headers and decoded texture checks. It now has a 180-second allowance;
all offline, byte-limit and cache assertions remain. There are 102 distinct
retained passes and 1,005 remaining cases, confirmed by Playwright.

The asset-cache workflow passed in 2.1 minutes, including offline reload. The
sloped-wall workflow then exceeded its 10-second 3D canvas readiness wait after
height edits, invalid-input handling, reversal, elevation and save/reload checks.
That boundary now allows 60 seconds within a 180-second workflow. Assertions
are unchanged. There are 103 retained distinct passes and 1,004 remaining cases,
confirmed by Playwright.

The sloped-wall workflow passed in 1.9 minutes. The floor-elevation workflow
then exhausted its 60-second total deadline while capturing a walkthrough
screenshot, after edit/Undo/reload/import/stacked-view assertions. Both viewport
variants now have a 180-second allowance, with every assertion retained.
There are 104 distinct retained passes and 1,003 remaining cases, confirmed
by Playwright.

The 1,003-case continuation passed 20 cases, including both floor-elevation
workflows. Furniture fidelity then exhausted its 60-second total deadline during
the second 3D color check, after initial color/model-reuse and saved-property
checks. Both viewport variants now have a 180-second allowance, retaining all
color, reload and resource-reuse assertions. There are 124 retained distinct
passes and 983 remaining cases, confirmed by Playwright.

The furniture rerun ended with zero passes at the blue-pixel probe's own
10-second deadline. The failure screenshot shows the navy chair rendered;
that observation alone does not prove the numeric pixel assertion. Both blue
readiness probes now allow 60 seconds, with thresholds and resource assertions
unchanged. The same 983-case inventory is rerunning; retained passes remain 124.

The subsequent attempt stopped earlier at the shared open3D helper's initial
10-second canvas-readiness assertion. That helper now allows 60 seconds.
No case passed in that attempt, so the same 983-case inventory remains and
retained passes are still 124. The blue-pixel readiness result remains unproven.

The next continuation passed six cases, including both furniture-fidelity
variants and late model reuse. The stair-drag case then raced tooltip dismissal;
the click log explicitly records DOM detachment. Four remaining `tip`-named
variants in geometry-drag-undo, stair-footprint, stair-ghost and stair-direction
now wait for hidden state (15 seconds). Geometry and Undo assertions remain.
There are 130 retained distinct passes and 977 remaining cases, confirmed by
Playwright.

The next continuation passed all seven geometry-drag cases. The legacy
migration workflow then exceeded its 10-second final 3D readiness wait, after
history/image backup and large-project save/reload preservation checks. That
boundary now allows 60 seconds within a 180-second workflow. Every storage and
network assertion remains. There are 137 retained distinct passes and 970
remaining cases, confirmed by Playwright.

The next continuation passed five cases (three storage and two field-keyboard
workflows). Metadata/photo verification then hit its 60-second total deadline
while entering 3D, after earlier editing/photo assertions. Both viewport variants
now allow 180 seconds, with a 60-second canvas readiness boundary. Backup and
export assertions remain intact. There are 142 retained distinct passes and 965
remaining cases, confirmed by Playwright.

The 965-case continuation passed 24 cases, including desktop library restore.
The mobile restore case then exceeded its final 10-second 3D readiness wait
after restore/history/recovery-data checks. That boundary now allows 60 seconds
within a 180-second workflow; all preservation assertions remain. There are
166 retained distinct passes and 941 remaining cases, confirmed by Playwright.

## Resume the running process

- Command: `npx playwright test --test-list /tmp/web-localization-remaining.txt --max-failures=1`
The 941-case continuation terminated after 80 passes. Native package
preview/import/edit/reload/export at 1440px passed its data and byte-exact
attachment checks, then timed out at its final 10-second canvas assertion.
The error snapshot showed “Loading 3D viewer…”. Both viewport variants now use
180 seconds overall and 60 seconds for that readiness boundary; assertions and
network guards are unchanged. Logs 2–19 contain 246 unique passes, each matched
to the original inventory. Playwright confirms 861 remaining cases. The runner
also reported one error outside a test without a separate diagnostic; no pass
credit is assigned to that error.

Session `27671` terminated with 97 passes and a failure in the unknown-furniture
saved-dimensions test. The screenshot visibly renders `missing-custom-model`;
the caption probe correctly expected “Unknown furniture”. The localized canvas
caller supplied the raw ID returned by `furnitureName` for an unknown catalog
entry, overriding the renderer fallback. This is a production regression, not
a readiness timeout. Together with prior stages, 343 cases passed on `87d3c86`.
The correction changes production code, so these results cannot be presented
as full qualification of the corrected runtime. Earlier active-session/log
entries above describe historical launches; no browser run is currently live.

Physical-device, native, release, fluent-language review and other NEXT gates
remain separate. Earlier full browser evidence applies to its named earlier
runtime, not automatically to this source.

## Corrected-runtime qualification

Production correction: `b3c7fa6`. Type checking passed with zero errors and
warnings; the production build passed. All nine focused browser cases passed
across Chromium, Firefox and WebKit in 2.6 minutes, covering localized known
captions, unknown saved/default dimensions, movement, rotation, resize, deletion
and exact undo/redo export comparisons. Log: `/tmp/web-unknown-caption-browser.log`.

A fresh full 1,107-case run is active in session `77795`, with log
`/tmp/web-caption-fixed-full-browser-1.log`. This starts qualification for the
corrected runtime; it does not reuse the previous runtime's 343 passes.
Poll the live handle before running competing browser tests or rebuilding.
Full completion remains unproven.

The corrected-runtime full run terminated after 104 passes (47.1 minutes).
The floor-elevation case passed its edit/reload/reimport checks, then reached
its 10-second canvas-readiness deadline while the snapshot showed the loading
message. The assertion now allows 60 seconds within the existing 180-second
workflow; geometry, stack, walkthrough, error and network checks are unchanged.
Production runtime remains `b3c7fa6`. The runner also reported an error outside
a test without a separate diagnostic; no completion credit is assigned to it.

The 104 unique passes match the original inventory. Playwright confirms 1,003
remaining cases. Session `77795` is terminal; continuation session `94916` runs
with log `/tmp/web-caption-fixed-full-browser-2.log`. Retained identities:
`/tmp/web-caption-fixed-passed.txt`; remaining inventory:
`/tmp/web-caption-fixed-remaining.txt`; validated list:
`/tmp/web-caption-fixed-continuation-inventory.log`. Do not mix these results
with the older `87d3c86` runtime. Full completion is still unproven.

Continuation `94916` terminated after 52 passes (25.7 minutes). Mobile legacy
furniture recovery reached its 10-second 3D canvas wait, with the error snapshot
showing “Loading 3D viewer…”. Its migration/edit/recovery checks had completed.
Both viewport variants now allow 60 seconds for canvas readiness within a
180-second workflow, preserving all byte, model-download and interaction checks.
No production code changed. The runner also reported an error outside a test
without a separate diagnostic; no completion credit is assigned to it.

Logs 1–2 contain 156 unique passes matched against the original inventory.
Playwright confirms 951 remaining cases. Session `32786` is active with log
`/tmp/web-caption-fixed-full-browser-3.log`; `94916` is terminal. The corrected
runtime's passed/remaining/list files have been updated. Full completion remains
unproven; poll the active handle before competing tests or production rebuilds.

Continuation `32786` terminated after 81 passes (27.0 minutes). The mobile
same-ID import case completed its pending-edit, separate-copy, persistence and
reopen checks, then reached the 10-second canvas-readiness deadline. The error
snapshot showed “Loading 3D viewer…”. That assertion now allows 60 seconds
within the existing 180-second workflow; all assertions remain. Production
runtime remains `b3c7fa6`. The runner also reported an error outside a test
without a separate diagnostic; no completion credit is assigned to it.

Logs 1–3 contain 237 distinct passes matched against the original inventory.
Playwright confirms 870 remaining cases. Session `8168` runs the continuation
in `/tmp/web-caption-fixed-full-browser-4.log`; `32786` is terminal. The
corrected-runtime passed/remaining/list files have been updated. Qualification
and the broader NEXT scope remain incomplete.

Stage 4 (`8168`) terminated with 40 passes in 18.2 minutes, bringing runtime
`b3c7fa6` to 277 passes. Save-conflict recovery completed its data assertions
but timed out at the 10-second 3D canvas wait; snapshot showed loading. The
wait now allows 60 seconds within 180 seconds overall, retaining all assertions.
The additional runner error had no separate diagnostic and earns no credit.
Production source now includes thumbnail fix `c14fce7`; prior passes do not
qualify that change. Type checking passed, and build session `17657` is active
with log `/tmp/web-reserved-thumbnail-build.log`. Validate the new thumbnail
cases and save-conflict workflow after the build, before further qualification.

Thumbnail fix `c14fce7` passed type checking, production build and all 24
focused thumbnail/save-conflict cases across three engines. Sessions `17657`,
`77574` and `98059` are terminal. Logs are recorded at the top of NEXT.md.
The new inventory has 1,116 cases; 24 unique current-runtime passes match it.
Session `44047` runs the remaining 1,092 in `/tmp/web-thumbnail-fixed-full-browser-1.log`.
The new inventory/passed/remaining files use `/tmp/web-thumbnail-fixed-` names.
Prior-runtime results do not qualify this source; broader work remains open.

Current-runtime session `44047` terminated after 243 passes (1.5 hours).
Furniture-category preview reached its 10-second canvas readiness deadline;
the snapshot showed mounted 3D controls. Both widths now allow 60 seconds
for readiness in a 180-second workflow. Category, metadata and exact model
download assertions remain unchanged. No production source changed. The
runner also reported an error outside a test without a separate diagnostic.
Combined with 24 focused passes, 267 distinct current-runtime cases match
the inventory. Playwright confirms 849 remaining tests in 138 files.
Continuation `99630` uses `/tmp/web-thumbnail-fixed-full-browser-2.log`;
passed/remaining files are updated, with validated list in
`/tmp/web-thumbnail-fixed-continuation-inventory.log`. Completion remains unproven.

Stage 2 (`99630`) terminated after 11 passes (5.8 minutes). Mobile damaged
import completed its atomicity, undo/redo, reload and extension checks, then
reached a 10-second canvas deadline while the snapshot showed loading. Both
widths now allow 60 seconds for readiness within a 180-second workflow. All
assertions remain and production source is unchanged. The runner also reported
an error outside a test without a separate diagnostic; it earns no pass credit.
There are 278 distinct current-runtime passes matched to the inventory;
Playwright confirms 838 remaining cases. Session `76367` runs them in
`/tmp/web-thumbnail-fixed-full-browser-3.log`. Passed/remaining/list files are
updated. Full qualification and wider NEXT requirements remain incomplete.


Stage 3 is terminal (session `76367`): 15 passed, 822 not run, and the nested-room slab workflow failed after label movement. At room-slabs.spec.ts:99, Undo left the label 40 pixels from its original position for the entire 10-second assertion. The preceding drag assertion passed. Current-runtime distinct passes total 293; the full suite is incomplete. An unchanged Chromium reproduction is active in session `32789`, `/tmp/web-nested-undo-repro.log`. No assertion or runtime change has been made while investigating.

The unchanged nested-room Chromium reproduction passed in 2.2 minutes (session `32789`, exit 0), including label Undo, image/PDF/package exports, openings and stacked-floor slab checks. Unique current-runtime passes are 294. This does not explain the intermittent stage-3 failure. The identical nested-room workflow is now running across all three engines with `--trace=on`, log `/tmp/web-nested-undo-all-engines.log`. No assertions were relaxed and no runtime change was made.

The traced all-engine nested-room workflow passed unchanged (session `59904`, exit 0): Chromium 2.2 minutes, Firefox 44.9 seconds, WebKit 35.5 seconds. Three trace archives were preserved in `/tmp/web-nested-undo-passing-traces` before continuing. The initial intermittent Undo failure remains unexplained/open. Inventory accounting verifies 296 unique current-runtime passes and 820 remaining cases; duplicate Chromium passes count once. Playwright `--list` confirms 820 tests in 138 files. Stage 4 is active in session `42770`, `/tmp/web-thumbnail-fixed-full-browser-4.log`; runtime and assertions are unchanged.

Stage 4 (session `42770`) terminated with zero new passes. The floor-switching slab workflow exhausted its 60-second total timeout while attempting the second Blender scene download (room-slabs.spec.ts:214); its first scene export and slab assertions had passed. The button was visible/enabled/stable, and Playwright was attempting the click when the overall budget expired. This import/reload/three-export workflow now uses `test.slow()` (180 seconds); every geometry, persistence, download and page-error assertion is unchanged. The 296 retained unique passes remain valid on unchanged production source. Playwright confirms the same 820 remaining cases; stage 5 is active in session `89669`, `/tmp/web-thumbnail-fixed-full-browser-5.log`.

Stage 5 (session `89669`) is terminal: 48 passed in 20.7 minutes, 771 not run, and the wall-photo 3D recovery case failed because its 15-second idle assertion observed no connected active WebGL context. Current-runtime unique passes total 344. Trace inspection shows the 3D viewer region/controls mounted and only the deliberately aborted brick request logged as a console error. The six 3D texture cases now use 180 seconds overall and a separate 60-second connected-first-draw wait before the unchanged 15-second idle check. Exact two-attempt recovery, pixel-change and redraw-without-input assertions are retained. Production is unchanged. Focused verification is active in session `24549`, `/tmp/web-texture-startup-browser.log`; the full suite is paused.

All six focused 3D texture-recovery cases passed in 3.3 minutes (session `24549`, exit 0), covering wall and floor recovery across Chromium, Firefox and WebKit. Idle-before-release, exact two requests and pixel change without further input all passed. Accounting against the full inventory verifies 350 unique current-runtime passes; Playwright confirms 766 remaining tests in 138 files. Stage 6 runs in session `43409`, `/tmp/web-thumbnail-fixed-full-browser-6.log`. Production is unchanged. The intermittent nested-room Undo failure remains unexplained/open.

Stage 6 (session `43409`) terminated after 24 passes (6.6 minutes), at viewer-idle.spec.ts:59 after orbiting. The 40-second idle assertion consistently saw one pending animation callback. Trace samples advanced from fired=20 to fired=169 during the window, approximately four frames/second. ThreeViewer uses fixed per-frame OrbitControls dampingFactor=0.08; slow damping is a hypothesis, not yet a confirmed root cause. Initial idle passed. The full suite is paused at 374 unique current-runtime passes; an unchanged Chromium reproduction runs with `/tmp/web-viewer-idle-repro.log`. No timeout or production change has been made.

The unchanged Chromium idle reproduction (session `88961`) failed again after orbit. Installed OrbitControls simulation requires 165 frames to settle the same large-scene orbit: 2.75 seconds at 60 fps versus 41.25 at 4 fps. Production now applies elapsed-time damping during scheduled orbit updates, restoring the configured factor afterward for pointer events and resetting the frame clock on sleep/walkthrough. All 26 focused damping/framing units passed, including trajectory agreement at 4–120 fps and settling within five seconds. Type check session `79798` and build session `33825` are active with `/tmp/web-orbit-damping-{check,build}.log`. Browser verification remains pending; the 374 thumbnail-runtime passes cannot qualify this changed runtime. Existing browser assertions are unchanged.

Orbit damping production source `03e0ae1` builds successfully (session `33825`, exit 0) and passes type checking with zero errors/warnings (session `79798`, exit 0). Logs: `/tmp/web-orbit-damping-build.log`, `/tmp/web-orbit-damping-check.log`. Focused browser verification is active in session `54192`, `/tmp/web-orbit-damping-browser.log`, covering viewer idle, framing and texture recovery in all three engines. Prior-runtime passes remain historical, not credit for this runtime.

All 18 focused orbit-runtime checks passed in 2.3 minutes (session `54192`, exit 0): idle/wake, framing and wall/floor texture recovery across Chromium, Firefox and WebKit. The browser idle assertion remains unchanged. The current 1,116-case inventory is `/tmp/web-orbit-fixed-inventory.log`; exact matching verifies 18 unique retained passes and 1,098 remaining tests in 137 files. Full orbit-runtime stage 1 is active in session `23185`, `/tmp/web-orbit-fixed-full-browser-1.log`, using `/tmp/web-orbit-fixed-remaining.txt`. Do not combine thumbnail-runtime pass credit with this runtime. The intermittent nested-room Undo issue and broader NEXT requirements remain open.


Orbit-runtime stage 1 is terminal (session `23185`, exit 1): 229 passed, one failed, 868 not run in 1.2 hours. Including the 18 focused cases, 247 distinct current-runtime cases passed. The PDF source test failed at line 31 because the main 3D canvas did not appear within 10 seconds; the snapshot still showed “Loading 3D viewer…”, and trace inspection found no console errors. No test or runtime change has been made. An unchanged traced Chromium reproduction is active in session `62767`, `/tmp/web-pdf-source-repro.log`. The full suite remains incomplete.


The unchanged PDF Chromium reproduction passed in 48.8 seconds (session `62767`, exit 0; `/tmp/web-pdf-source-repro.log`). Trace timing records 13.27 seconds for successful canvas visibility despite the 10-second configured wait. The test now gives lazy viewer startup 60 seconds and the multi-export workflow 180 seconds; all source-selection, page-count, recovery, notices and failed-download assertions are retained. Production is unchanged; 248 distinct current-runtime passes are established. All-engine verification is active in session `77637`, `/tmp/web-pdf-source-all-engines.log`.


All three PDF source cases passed in two minutes (session `77637`, terminal exit 0; `/tmp/web-pdf-source-all-engines.log`): Chromium 52.5 seconds, Firefox 27.1 seconds, WebKit 21.5 seconds. Every export assertion is retained. Production remains `03e0ae1`. Exact inventory matching establishes 250 unique passes; Playwright confirms 866 remaining tests in 136 files. Full stage 2 is active in session `46921`, `/tmp/web-orbit-fixed-full-browser-2.log`, using `/tmp/web-orbit-fixed-remaining.txt`. Full qualification and broader NEXT requirements remain incomplete.


Orbit-runtime stage 2 terminated (session `46921`, exit 1): 282 passed, one failed, 583 not run in 56.2 minutes, bringing current-runtime passes to 532. Firefox item-details.spec.ts:224 waited for its second photo chooser until the 60-second test deadline, although the Add photo click completed about five seconds into the test. The snapshot shows the expected quota-error banner after the note edit. Trace/context are preserved in `/tmp/web-photo-chooser-failure`. An unchanged traced Firefox reproduction runs in session `43729`, `/tmp/web-photo-chooser-repro.log`. No timeout, assertion or runtime change has been made.


The unchanged Firefox photo/quota reproduction passed in 39.2 seconds (session `43729`, exit 0). The failed trace's click used the old button coordinates while autosave could insert the quota banner; this suggests a layout race but does not prove one. The test now waits for that expected storage-full alert after the note edit and before opening the photo picker. All original assertions are retained and production is unchanged. Traced all-engine verification runs in session `80528`, `/tmp/web-photo-quota-all-engines.log`. Current-runtime unique passes are 533 including the unchanged Firefox reproduction.


All three synchronized photo/quota recovery cases passed in 2.6 minutes (session `80528`, terminal exit 0; `/tmp/web-photo-quota-all-engines.log`). Original assertions remain intact; the original layout-race hypothesis remains unproven. Exact inventory matching establishes 534 unique current-runtime passes, counting the repeated Chromium case only once. Playwright confirms 582 remaining tests in 136 files. Full stage 3 runs in session `63876`, `/tmp/web-orbit-fixed-full-browser-3.log`, using `/tmp/web-orbit-fixed-remaining.txt`. Production remains `03e0ae1`; broader NEXT work remains incomplete.


Stage 3 terminated (session `63876`, exit 1): 33 passed, one failed, 548 not run in 10.4 minutes. Current-runtime unique passes are 567. Mobile Firefox's five-dialog modal keyboard workflow hit its total 60-second budget at the final editor Backspace action after completing the dialog-loop checks; desktop Firefox passed in 57.4 seconds. Both widths now use `test.slow()` (180 seconds), retaining every focus, keyboard, geometry, storage, export and Undo assertion. Production is unchanged. Six focused cases across all three engines run in session `25685`, `/tmp/web-modal-focus-all-engines.log`.


All six modal keyboard cases passed in 8.6 minutes (session `25685`, terminal exit 0; `/tmp/web-modal-focus-all-engines.log`), preserving all assertions at both widths in Chromium, Firefox and WebKit. Exact inventory matching establishes 570 distinct current-runtime passes; repeated Chromium and desktop Firefox cases count once. Playwright confirms 546 remaining tests in 136 files. Full stage 4 runs in session `22429`, `/tmp/web-orbit-fixed-full-browser-4.log`, using `/tmp/web-orbit-fixed-remaining.txt`. Production remains `03e0ae1`; full qualification and broader NEXT work remain incomplete.


Stage 4 remains live in session `22429`. Exact inventory matching across orbit-runtime logs confirms 372/372 Chromium and 372/372 Firefox cases passed; WebKit has 17 passes with 355 remaining at this checkpoint (761 total). Production remains `03e0ae1`; no competing run was started. Nested-room workflows passed in these engines, but the earlier intermittent Undo failure remains unexplained. WebKit qualification and broader NEXT requirements remain open.


## Current browser qualification — all 1,116 cases passed

Full stage 4 finished successfully (session `22429`, terminal exit 0):
546 passed in 1.5 hours; `/tmp/web-orbit-fixed-full-browser-4.log`.
Exact inventory matching across the four continuation stages and focused
verification logs confirms 1,116 unique current-runtime passes: 372 each in
Chromium, Firefox and WebKit. Repeated cases count only once. Production
remains `03e0ae1`; this qualification combines the resumed runs and focused
reruns after test synchronization/budget fixes, rather than one uninterrupted
suite run. No browser qualification process remains active.

The earlier intermittent nested-room Undo failure remains unexplained despite
passing subsequent coverage. Broader NEXT requirements remain incomplete.
