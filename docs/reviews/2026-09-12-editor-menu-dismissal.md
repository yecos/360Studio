# Editor dismissal after a menu edit — September 12, 2026

Source baseline `aaafdbe`, app `/tmp/OpenPlan3D-Scan-Local-Dismiss-QA.app`, isolated
bundle `com.laan.labs.floorplan.underlayfloorqa`. This is a fresh reproduction,
not a claim that the separate editor dismissal issue is fixed.

Opened synthetic session `CBED6B12-F123-4944-AF81-B76ADF7976EA` through review →
Plan → Edit Plan. Done without edits returned to review at the next AX check.
Reopened the editor, chose Add → Living → Chair, clicked Rotate Right, then Done.
The editor remained visible at both subsequent AX and screenshot checks. No
canvas drag was used in this reproduction.

The saved plan file already contained four walls and one chair, ID
`B5599360-54BF-4668-9F56-CC68C3F842B3`, center (2,1.5), width/depth 0.5 metres,
angle 0.2617993877991494 radians. This separates successful persistence from the
pending dismissal. File modification epoch: 1789231607.4898024. Escape was used
to leave the editor, and the isolated QA app was quit. No installed Development
app was used and no production source changed during the running simulator test.

## Next experiment

Test dismissal resolved inside the editor button, as verified for the separate
import/export sheets. Preserve the existing close callback and dismiss only if
save succeeds: an unconditional dismiss after save would lose the editor on a
write failure. Verify no-edit Done, edited Done, Close, and a safely induced save
failure in an isolated disposable session. Retain the change only with evidence.

The input/framework cause remains unseparated; one successful no-edit close does
not overturn earlier intermittent failures. Prior gesture-reset and timed/async
close experiments in `docs/native-editor-dismissal.md` did not establish a fix.

The full-scan simulator session `50299` subsequently terminated successfully.
Log: `/tmp/native-scan-local-dismiss-ios.log`.

## Save failure and recovery baseline

Using the same isolated session, added a table in memory, recorded the existing
plan SHA-256, and temporarily removed directory write permissions (0755 → 0555).
Done showed Couldn't Save with a permission error. Restored 0755 immediately and
verified the original plan bytes were unchanged. After acknowledging the alert,
the selected table and Undo remained in the editor. Retrying Done saved both
chair and table and returned to review. The QA app was quit; directory mode 0755
and both saved categories were verified. Restoration metadata is in
`/tmp/openplan-editor-save-failure-state.json`.

The next experiment uses a button-local dismiss environment gated by a Bool
save result. It retains existing callbacks and returns false on unloaded/error
paths. Catalyst build session `95232` finished with exit 0 (`BUILD SUCCEEDED`)
in `/tmp/native-editor-local-dismiss-build.log`.

## Button-local candidate validation

Runtime `8ed0b20`, isolated app
`/tmp/OpenPlan3D-Editor-Local-Dismiss-Sept12-QA.app`, same synthetic session.
The installed Development app was not used.

- Added a sofa through the menu, rotated right, and pressed Done. Review appeared
  at the next AX check; the file contained the sofa at angle 0.2617993877991494.
- Added a television, recorded the saved hash, and temporarily changed only the
  synthetic session directory from 0755 to 0555. Done showed Couldn't Save.
  Restored 0755 immediately; the saved hash was unchanged. Acknowledging the
  alert retained the selected television and Undo. Retrying Done saved it and
  returned to review, with four objects (chair, table, sofa, television).
- Added an unsaved fireplace and clicked Close. Review appeared with four objects.
  The saved file SHA-256 stayed
  `c630a18efaf494c7ea6560119ed8a531adb5de22627d11fa332e7161ca507366`,
  matching `/tmp/openplan-editor-before-discard.sha256`. Directory mode was 0755.
- Reopened with no edits and clicked Done. Review appeared at the next AX check.
  The QA app was quit. No Escape or debugger assisted these candidate checks.

These checks qualify the review-to-editor menu-edit, discard, no-edit, and
save-failure/retry paths on Catalyst. They do not establish physical-device,
load-error, canvas-gesture, or long-run intermittent behavior.
Simulator `PlanRecoveryTests` session `37936` remains live at this checkpoint,
log `/tmp/native-editor-local-dismiss-ios.log`; no test result is claimed yet.


## Home entry follow-up

Using the same candidate QA app, Home → Draw a Plan created synthetic manual
session `8332EE79-9FB4-48E3-9FDE-396BB73D799F` (Floor Plan 1). Added a chair,
rotated right, and clicked Done. Home appeared at the next AX check with the new
plan card. Reopening the card showed four walls, one door, one window and one
chair. The saved `plan.json` contains chair
`42D6DBA2-3CA5-4B39-9135-12F2A8490A62` at angle 0.2617993877991494 radians.
The QA app was quit without Escape or debugger assistance. This additionally
qualifies edited Done from Home's manual-plan presentation on Catalyst; it does
not replace the remaining load-error, canvas-gesture, physical-device or long-run
checks. Simulator session `37936` was re-polled and remains live.


## Load-error Close and Retry follow-up

In the same isolated candidate app, opened manual QA session
`8332EE79-9FB4-48E3-9FDE-396BB73D799F` in review before temporarily replacing
its `plan.json` with malformed JSON. The original bytes were backed up to
`/tmp/editor-load-error-sept12-original.json`. Edit Plan showed Couldn't Open
Plan, Export Original File, Retry and Close. Close returned to review at the
next AX check. Reopening showed the error again; the malformed bytes had not
changed. Restored the exact original bytes while this error screen was open.
Retry entered the editor with Undo/Redo disabled. Close returned to review;
the QA app was quit. Final file bytes still matched the original backup,
SHA-256 `4ccd0455c32a9e9372c556b19616bf88519034fdcdc89b4cf82ebaeb511bf38b`.
No Escape or debugger was used. This verifies load-error Close and restored-file
Retry on Catalyst, not recovery from scan or original-file export.
Simulator session `37936` was re-polled and remains live at this checkpoint.


## Simulator completion

Session `37936` terminated with exit 0 and TEST SUCCEEDED. All 11
`PlanRecoveryTests` passed with zero failures (0.881 seconds test execution;
1.319 seconds selected suite elapsed). Log:
`/tmp/native-editor-local-dismiss-ios.log`; result:
`/tmp/openplan3d-autolabel-qa/Logs/Test/Test-FloorPlan-2026.09.12_13-32-01--0400.xcresult`.
This compiles runtime `8ed0b20` for iPhone simulator and checks document
preservation/recovery and review data behavior. UI dismissal evidence above is
Catalyst-only; these tests do not drive simulator editor UI.
